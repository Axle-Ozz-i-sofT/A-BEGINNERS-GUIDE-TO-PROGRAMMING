# Space Shoot SDL_Bgi V1.

A simple space shooter demo based upon SDL_Bgi.  
https://sdl-bgi.sourceforge.io/  

This is a first version attempt at a small shooter game using the library SDL_Bgi.  
I have made every effort toward staying with what is provided within the SDL_Bgi API without using any of the underlaying SDL2 functions.  
The Game logic progressed as I built upon it and became a little bit difficult to follow so I have tidied some of that up, although still in need of some work.  
I only have a very modest limiter on the CPU cycles in this version so FPS is not really controled or restricted. I have corrected this in V2.x.x.x  
The main point was to see what I could acheive with the old BGI API.  
I created this and offer it up as a demo for others who may be looking at making use of the graphics.h library.  
I would consider also looking at Version 2.x.x.x as I have corrected and highlighted many of the limitations and issues that I had encountered.  
Version 2 also offers a demonstration of using a game intro and outro :)  

You will need both SDL2 development version as wel as SDL_Bgi Version 3.  
Please read my booklet "A Beginners Guide To SDL_bgi.pdf" for how to set up the library as well as setting up the project in Dev-C++ and Code::Blocks.

At the moment I have only done some C labguage demos but I am looking at creating some SDL_Bgi demos in both FreeBASIC and Python3 as well.
