# Book 3 supplimental
## Installing and using SDL2 and SDL-BGI (Graphics.h) Libraries.

This is a basic guide for setting up and using SDL_Bgi On Windows and Linux. At this Time I have only created some C language examples but do endevour to add setup guides and examples for FreeBASIC and Python3.

The source has been tested on Windows 10 and Lubuntu 20.04. Some examples will run in a VirtualBox client but the VirtualBox hardware and graphics will fail for more complex demos.

This is a supplimental to **"Book 3 - Libraries Overview"**

The booklet is downloadable as a PDF. Please check the "example source" directory for the Hello World examples from the book (Don't copy the source from the PDF as the code formating will be broken).
