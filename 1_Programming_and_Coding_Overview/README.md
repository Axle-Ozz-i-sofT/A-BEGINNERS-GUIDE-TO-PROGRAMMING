# Book 1 - Programming and Coding Overview

Final Draft Preview V0.23	- 23/10/2022

A BEGINNERS GUIDE TO PROGRAMMING is a series of books to assist beginners in understanding the fundamentals of computer programming and coding.

Book 1 - Programming and Coding Overview covers the fundimental principles of "Programming". It has been created with an orientation toward programming rather than coding in any particular language. All examples are duplicated in C, FreeBASIC and Python 3 with the programming flow remaining much the same in a "Rosetta Stone" styled approach. This should allow a learner to distinguish between the different programming language keywords and syntax as well as the common underlying programming methodology used in all three languages.  

Book 2 - Development Environment Overview will cover the essentials needed to set up the development environments for examples used in book 1.
