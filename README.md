# A BEGINNERS GUIDE TO PROGRAMMING
Introduce beginners to the fundamentals of software development.

A BEGINNERS GUIDE TO PROGRAMMING is a series of books to assist beginners in understanding the fundamentals of computer programming and coding.

The books have been created with an orientation toward programming rather than coding in any particular language. All examples are duplicated in C, FreeBASIC and Python 3 with the programming flow remaining much the same in a "Rosetta Stone" styled approach. This should allow a learner to distinguish between the different programming language keywords and syntax as well as the common underlying programming methodology used in each language.

At this time I have 6 proposed books in the series. The first 2 books focus on on programming fundamentals and setting up the development environments and IDEs. The development environments used are not an indication of the the "Best" commercial development paradigm, but reflect a low cost and simple method for students to "get their feet wet" without too much confusion.

The last 4 books cover the essentials of using additional libraries in the programming environment as well as explaining the use of "Static" and "Dynamic" libraries. I will cover 6 main library paradigms in the books and examples.

Book 3 will cover implementation, building and use in a project of the following: 

* Standard libs
* TUI Libs
* Graphics and GUI libs
* Database libs
* Data manipulation and plotting libs
* Multimedia libs

Books 4 to 6 will cover project examples using the libraries in C, FreeBASIC and Python 3 in the same "Rosetta Stone" style.


This project is currently at various stages of development. Books are a mix from "Draft" (Partial and incomplete) to "Draft Preview" (Final with possible errors and or omissions to be corrected) and the example source code will vary from alpha (Missing components) to beta (May still contain bugs).

I am not an engineer, just an enthusiastic mature age tertiary student attempting to be helpful to our younger (or older) fellow students with an interest in ICT and computer programming. The hope is to remove some of the confusion and fear factor from what is an exceptional complex industry :)
Maybe it is enough to encourage some towards pursuing higher level studies in engineering.

P.S. I am new to GitHub and still learning my way...
