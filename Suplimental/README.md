# Book 3 supplimental
## Installing and using SDL2 and SDL-BGI (Graphics.h) Libraries.
 
This is a basic guide for setting up and using SDL_Bgi On Windows and Linux.
At this Time I have only created some C language examples but do endevour to add setup guides and examples for FreeBASIC and Python3.

The source has been tested on Windows 1 and Lubuntu 20.04. Some examples will run in a VirtualBox client but the VirtualBox hardware an graphics will fail for more complex demos.

This is a supplimental to **"Book 3 - Libraries Overview"**

The booklet is downloadable as a PDF. Please check the "example source" directory for the Hello World examples from the book (Don't copy the source from the PDF as the code formating will be broken).
