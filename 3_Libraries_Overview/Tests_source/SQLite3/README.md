## Basic Sqlite3 "Hello world" using ctypes keeping the C API
This is still a "Draft" alpha version of "sql_hello_world.py".  
It is currently functional, but needs much tidying and minimizing.
  
sqlite3.dll or libsqlite.so.n must be in the system path or script directory (manually selected in the scripts).
  
This will become part of an archive collection of source code that will accompany Book 3 "A Beginners Guide To Libs.pdf".

I have also decided to provide the C and FreeBASIC source for context.
