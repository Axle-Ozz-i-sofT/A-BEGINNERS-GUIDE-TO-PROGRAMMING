# Book 3 - Development Libraries Overview

An introduction to the essentials of using additional libraries in the programming environment as well as explaining the use of "Static" and "Dynamic" libraries.  

Book 3 will cover implementation, building and use in a project of the following:  
* Standard libs - libc
* TUI Libs - Cursers
* Graphics and GUI libs - raylib and raygui (Note: I have recently added an overview of DOS development environments. I want to keep the graphics as simple primative examples using either the BGI or Allegro styles APIs to keep all books aligned. Raylib is an awsome library so I will move the raylib section to a supplimental booklet atached to Book 3.)
* Database libs - SQLite 3
* Data manipulation and plotting libs - GNU Plot
* Multimedia libs - MPV

Current statis - late draft
